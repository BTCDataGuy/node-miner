version: "1.0.2"
tagline: Bitcoin CPU mining on your Umbrel node
description: >-
  Bitcoin CPU mining on your Umbrel node - for education and fun, not profit.
  
  
  Node Miner enables Bitcoin CPU mining directly on your Umbrel node using cpuminer-multi. Perfect for node operators who want to experiment with mining without dedicated hardware.
  
  
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is for education and fun, not profit. CPU mining Bitcoin is unprofitable - you'll spend more on electricity than you'll earn.
  
  
  Features:
  
  - Flexible Pool Configuration: Connect to external pools or internal pools on the same Umbrel (use 172.17.0.1 for internal)
  
  - Adjustable CPU Usage: Set mining intensity from 1-100% of your CPU power
  
  - Real-time Dashboard: Monitor hashrate, mining statistics, and system resources
  
  - Simple Controls: Easy start/stop buttons with live status updates
  
  
  Recommended for Beginners:
  
  Start with Public Pool (available in Umbrel App Store) - lower difficulty means you'll see results within minutes, perfect for testing and learning.
  
  
  ⚠️ System Overload Warning: Mining with high CPU percentages (>50%) can overload your system. Start low (10-20%) and monitor carefully!
  
  
  Configuration:
  
  - Pool URL formats: stratum+tcp://pool.example.com:3333 or pool.example.com:3333
  
  - For internal pools on same Umbrel: use 172.17.0.1 instead of localhost
  
  - CPU Usage: 10-20% safe, 30-40% monitor closely, 50%+ high risk
